        <h3>Reporting Verbs and Their Patterns:</h3>
        <div class="note">
            <p>Different reporting verbs can be used to show the speaker's attitude or the way something was said:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Say</strong> + (that) + clause: "I'm tired," he said. → He said (that) he was tired.</li>
                <li><strong>Tell</strong> + object + (that) + clause: "I love you," she told me. → She told me (that) she loved me.</li>
                <li><strong>Ask</strong> + (object) + if/whether: "Are you coming?" → She asked (me) if I was coming.</li>
                <li><strong>Order/Command</strong> + object + to + base verb: "Sit down!" → He ordered me to sit down.</li>
                <li><strong>Advise</strong> + object + to + base verb: "You should study." → She advised me to study.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Special Cases:</h3>
        <div class="example">
            <h4>1. Requests with 'would', 'could', 'can'</h4>
            <p><strong>Direct:</strong> "Could you help me?" she asked.</p>
            <p><strong>Reported:</strong> She asked me to help her.</p>
            
            <h4>2. Suggestions with 'let's'</h4>
            <p><strong>Direct:</strong> "Let's go to the cinema," he said.</p>
            <p><strong>Reported:</strong> He suggested going to the cinema. OR He suggested that we go to the cinema.</p>
            
            <h4>3. General truths</h4>
            <p><strong>Direct:</strong> "The Earth revolves around the Sun," the teacher said.</p>
            <p><strong>Reported (no tense change):</strong> The teacher said that the Earth revolves around the Sun.</p>
            
            <h4>4. Reporting questions</h4>
            <p><strong>Yes/No questions:</strong> "Are you coming?" → She asked if/whether I was coming.</p>
            <p><strong>Wh- questions:</strong> "Where do you live?" → He asked where I lived.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Practice Exercise:</h3>
        <div class="note">
            <p>Change these sentences to reported speech:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>"I can't come to the party," John said. → John said that ___________________________.</li>
                <li>"Where are you going?" she asked. → She asked me ___________________________.</li>
                <li>"Don't touch that!" the teacher said to the students. → The teacher told the students ___________________________.</li>
                <li>"I've never been to Paris," said Mary. → Mary said that ___________________________.</li>
                <li>"Will you help me with my homework?" Tom asked. → Tom asked me ___________________________.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-section">
        <h2>4. Complex Sentences</h2>
        <p>Complex sentences contain one independent clause and at least one dependent clause.</p>
        
        <h3>Types of Dependent Clauses:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adverbial Clauses:</strong> Show when, where, why, how, or under what conditions something happens.
                <div class="example">After I finish work, I will go to the gym.</div>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Adjective Clauses:</strong> Describe a noun (also called relative clauses).
                <div class="example">The book that I borrowed from the library is very interesting.</div>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Noun Clauses:</strong> Function as a noun in the sentence.
                <div class="example">I know that you are telling the truth.</div>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Subordinating Conjunctions:</h3>
        <p>These words introduce dependent clauses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Time: when, while, after, before, since, until, as soon as</li>
            <li>Cause/Effect: because, since, as, so that</li>
            <li>Condition: if, unless, provided that, as long as</li>
            <li>Contrast: although, though, even though, whereas, while</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Tip:</strong> When a dependent clause comes before the independent clause, use a comma after it.
            <div class="example">Because it was raining, we stayed inside.</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-section">

        <h2>6. Passive Voice</h2>
        <p>The passive voice is used when the focus is on the action rather than who performed it.</p>
        
        <h3>Formation:</h3>
        <p>Subject + be + past participle (by + agent)</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Active:</strong> The chef prepared the meal.</p>
            <p><strong>Passive:</strong> The meal was prepared by the chef.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>When to Use Passive Voice:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When the doer is unknown or unimportant</li>
            <li>When the action is more important than the doer</li>
            <li>In formal or scientific writing</li>
